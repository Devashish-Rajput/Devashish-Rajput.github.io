      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
We are Anil Nayar, Tanya Singhal, and James Abraham.  We've been developing solar plants and technologies in India since 2009. Prior to SolarArise, we developed over 20MW's of operational PV solar plants; led one of the first project-financing for solar plants; led the largest public-private partnership in solar R&D with the government of India; and were instrumental in the development of policies for the sector. At SolarArise, we bring together our technical, financial, and developmental skills to build a portfolio of solar plants that will generate consistent, low-risk returns for investors. Every prudent investment manager should have our solar plants in their portfolio. </p>
